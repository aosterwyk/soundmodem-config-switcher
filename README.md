# Soundmodem Config Switcher

[![GitHub release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/aosterwyk/soundmodem-config-switcher?sort=semver)](https://github.com/aosterwyk/soundmodem-config-switcher/releases) [![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/aosterwyk/soundmodem-config-switcher)](https://github.com/aosterwyk/soundmodem-config-switcher/commits/master) 

This script will check for files named `soundmodem.ini.*` and rename it to `soundmodem.ini` for easy config switching with [UZ7HO's soundmodem](http://uz7.ho.ua/packetradio.htm). 
This script and the repo owner are not associated with the soundmodem application. 

## Usage

- Download the script (switch-soundmodem-configs.ps1) and move it to your soundmodem install directory.
- Create and rename different soundmodem config to `soundmodem.ini.<config>` (ex: `soundmodem.ini.digirig` and `soundmodem.ini.ic705`)
- Run the script and select the config you want to use. 
    NOTE: The script will **delete the existing soundmodem.ini** before the selected config!
